# Ripples
This is a cool little mixin I made in SCSS for button animations. Hover over the buttons to see the magic! I hope you like it and I hope it comes in handy for you!

##Usage
* First, clone this repo or download the mixins and functions folders found in the `src` folder
* Second, import these into your stylesheet. An example of doing this can be found [here](https://github.com/Jackthomsonn/ripples/blob/master/src/example.scss)

* You can now go ahead & start adding animations with one line of code to any elements you wish!

##Example
`button {
    @include ripples(#FEFEFE, 20, 50)
}`
